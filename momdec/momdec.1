.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm momdec
is a command-line tool for Mac OS X that takes a compiled Core Data model and decompiles it to produce an equivalent
.Ar xcdatamodel
or
.Ar xcdatamodeld
suitable for use in Xcode. The resulting model file can also be used with
.Nm mogenerator
to produce source code files for Core Data entities which have custom subclasses.
.Pp                      \" Inserts a space
The first argument is the full path to a 
.Ar .mom
or
.Ar .momd
, and the second is the location where the results should be written. If the second argument is omitted, the current working directory is used. Output files are automatically named based on the inputs.

If the first argument is a 
.Ar .mom
, that is, a single managed object model, 
.Nm momdec
produces a 
.Ar .xcdatamodel
. If the first argument is a 
.Ar .momd
(which potentially contains multiple managed object models),
.Nm momdec
produces a
.Ar .xcdatamodeld
containing all models found, as well as a
.Ar .xccurrentversion
file (if appropriate) indicating the current version

See this project's README.md for more detail.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Create Foo.xcdatamodel in /private/tmp/:

    momdec Foo.mom /private/tmp/

Create Foo.xcdatamodeld in the current working directory. This bundle will include all model versions present in the momd and (if appropriate) a .xccurrentversion file:

    momdec Foo.momd

.Sh BUGS              \" Document known, unremedied bugs 
Min/max values on Core Data decimal attributes will not be correct if the limits are not integers, because Xcode truncates the limits to integers at compile time. Further details at
